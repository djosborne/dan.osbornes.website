Hi, I'm Dan, welcome to my website.

I'm an engineer at Tigera, and work as a maintainer on Project Calico. I dabble a lot in open source cloud
technologies, like Kubernetes, Terraform, and GCP.

Some of these technologies are so bleeding edge that I often find myself browsing source code and github issues
to get answers to my questions, as I'm sure some of you can relate.

This blog is my attempt at giving back to the community, fill information gaps, and make the cloud an easier
experience.

Though I'm pretty friendly in real life, I like to keep my writing short and sweet. I don't want to have
to read someone's entire life story just to get a lasagna recipe online, ya know?
